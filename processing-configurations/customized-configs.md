# Customized Processing Configurations
There may be times when a specific project requires its own specific configuration. For example, you may wish to turn off some of the micro-services that are run by all of the [standardized processing configurations](standardized-configs.md) (e.g. run virus scans, check for credit card numbers and other personal information, ocr images).

Create one-off processing configs as needed, giving them a descriptive name. You should document the config settings on the project / collection file, but it is not necessary to retain the config after project completed.
