###### [Archivematica Manual](../README.md) `>` Processing Configurations

# Processing Configurations
This page lists the Archives' `processing configurations`. There is a separate page for each that documents settings and provides a brief description / rationale. The Archives has two processing pipelines, one for standard transfers and the other (with more dedicated RAM and disk space) for larger transfers and files (e.g. video).

## Standard configuration
The default configuration is the same for both pipelines. See the [Decision points page](../ingest-guidelines/decisions-points.md) for discussion of options on microservices that require intervention.
- [Standard Processing Configuration](standard.md)
- [Decision Points](../ingest-guidelines/decisions-points.md).
