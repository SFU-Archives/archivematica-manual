# Errors

<!---
Normalization failures will also generate an Archivematica email report.
- You should save these reports and upload to the AIS in the AIP's `Event` log.
- These emails sometimes cannot be printed / pdf'ed easily (file names may not fit the screen).
- In those cases, it is better to copy the table data from the email into a `csv` and save / upload it in this format.
