# Ingest Guidelines: Overview
This section describes how to process a `transfer package` through the Archivematica `Dashboard`.
- This assumes you have already copied the `transfer package` to the Archivematica `transfer source location`; see [Upload to the Staging Server](../pre-ingest-actions/upload-to-the-staging-server.md).

There are two key components of the Archives' practice.

(1) **All** `transfer packages` are sent through Archivematica to completion.
- This includes ones that have not yet been "processed", i.e. the content of the transfer still needs to be appraised, selected, and arranged and described.
- Transfers not yet processed in respect of their contents are considered and registered in the AIS as `backlog AIPs`.
- When an archivist is ready to arrange and describe a `backlog AIP`, they download and re-ingest it for processing.
- On completion the archivist deletes the original `backlog AIP` while retaining its METS file as part of the `Submission documentation` of the new AIP..
- See [Processing Backlog](../ingest-scenrios/processing-backlog.md) for more information about this scenario.

The main advantage of this **full ingest** approach (implemented in 2021) is that all materials put through Archivematica get a consistent treatment (including full normalization). This is useful where some materials may sit in unprocessed in storage for many years before they can be arranged and described.

(2) If a DIP is created, it is **always** stored.
- This decision (implemented ca. 2016) ensures that access copies of all materials are always readily available and can be easily downloaded for offline delivery to researchers.
- Useful because many materials cannot be upload directly to AtoM pending an [access and copyright review](../dip-management/access-and-privacy-review.md) (and again, there may be a long timelag before this occurs).
